LSTM model for forecasting wind-power generation

Python script to analyze wind-power-generation dataset and predict value at each timestep using a LSTM model. 
Data downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/jorgesandoval/wind-power-generation/code
Data are in 15-minute timesteps, from 23/08/2019 to 22/09/2020. Units are Terrawatt hours. 
Each datapoint is a summed value (total) for all of one company's (Ampiron) wind-power stations in Germany.
